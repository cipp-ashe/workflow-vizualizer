# Workflow Visualizer Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Shared Module Structure

✅ Created the basic directory structure:

```
src/
└── components/
    └── workflow/
        ├── shared/
        │   ├── constants/
        │   │   ├── index.ts
        │   │   ├── layoutConstants.ts
        │   │   └── styleConstants.ts
        │   ├── types/
        │   │   ├── index.ts
        │   │   └── workflowTypes.ts
        │   └── utils/
        │       ├── index.ts
        │       ├── referenceUtils.ts
        │       └── transitionUtils.ts
        ├── viewer/
        │   └── layout/
        │       ├── index.ts
        │       ├── layoutEngine.ts
        │       └── dagLayout.ts
        │   └── hooks/
        │       └── useWorkflowLayout.ts
        └── node/
```

### 2. Implemented Configuration System

✅ Created centralized configuration files:

- `layoutConstants.ts`: Configuration for layout parameters
- `styleConstants.ts`: Configuration for visual styling

### 3. Implemented Layout Engine

✅ Created the core layout engine components:

- `layoutEngine.ts`: Core layout engine interface and implementation
- `dagLayout.ts`: DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) layout algorithm

### 4. Implemented Layout Hook

✅ Created the React hook for integrating the layout engine:

- `useWorkflowLayout.ts`: Hook for applying automatic layout to workflow nodes

### 5. Migrated Components

✅ Created the TaskNode components:

- `TaskNodeHeader.tsx`: Header component for task nodes
- `TaskNodeDetails.tsx`: Details component for task nodes
- `TransitionTabs.tsx`: Transition tabs component for task nodes
- `useTaskNode.ts`: Hook for managing task node state

✅ Created the WorkflowViewer components:

- `WorkflowSelector.tsx`: Component for selecting workflows
- `WorkflowBreadcrumb.tsx`: Component for breadcrumb navigation
- `WorkflowNavigation.tsx`: Component for workflow navigation
- `WorkflowCanvas.tsx`: Component for rendering the workflow canvas

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Fix Remaining Import Errors

✅ Completed:

- ✅ Fixed the import error in `src/components/workflow/node/index.ts` for TaskNode
- ✅ Fixed the LayoutConfig interface to include all properties used in the implementation
- ✅ Fixed the order of declarations in the constants.ts file
- ✅ Ensured all components can be properly imported
- ✅ Updated import paths in App.tsx and TestWorkflow.tsx to use the new structure

### 2. Move Remaining Files

✅ Completed:

The following files have been migrated from the old structure:

**From src/components/WorkflowViewer:**

- ✅ components/WorkflowControls.tsx
- ✅ components/WorkflowLegend.tsx
- ✅ components/ControlPanel.tsx
- ✅ constants/legendItems.ts
- ✅ constants/nodeTypes.ts
- ✅ hooks/useEdgeHighlighting.ts
- ✅ hooks/useNodeHandlers.ts
- ✅ hooks/useReactFlowConfig.ts
- ✅ utils/edgeUtils.ts
- ✅ utils/nodeUtils.ts
- ✅ utils/referenceUtils.ts
- ✅ utils/templateUtils.ts
- ✅ The entire WorkflowViewer directory has been removed

**From src/components/TaskNode:**

- ✅ All files have been migrated and the old files have been removed

### 3. Remove Old Files

✅ Completed:

- ✅ Removed `src/components/WorkflowViewer/utils/positionUtils.ts` - Functionality has been replaced by the new layout engine in dagLayout.ts and layoutEngine.ts
- ✅ Removed `src/components/WorkflowViewer/hooks/useWorkflowLayout.ts` - The new useWorkflowLayout.ts hook uses the layout engine
- ✅ Removed `src/components/WorkflowViewer/constants/layoutConstants.ts` - The old values have been preserved in the new layoutConstants.ts file in a legacy object
- ✅ Removed the entire `src/components/WorkflowViewer` directory
- ✅ Removed the entire `src/components/TaskNode` directory
- ✅ Updated import paths in App.tsx to use the new structure
- ✅ Ensured all functionality is migrated before removal

### 4. Add User Controls for Layout Configuration

✅ Completed:

- ✅ Added UI controls for adjusting layout parameters
- ✅ Implemented layout presets for common scenarios
- ✅ Added a "reset layout" button to revert to default settings

### 5. Testing and Validation

✅ Completed:

- ✅ Added debugging to help identify and fix issues with the workflow visualization
- ✅ Fixed issues with workflow initialization and data structure handling
- ✅ Improved error handling and type safety in the workflow processing code
- ✅ Enhanced edge visualization with step-type edges for clearer directional flow
- ✅ Improved layout spacing parameters to give task nodes more breathing room
- ✅ Modified the DAG layout algorithm to better handle node positioning and relationships
- ✅ Implemented intelligent node ordering based on connection relationships
- ✅ Fixed issues with nodes overlapping and edge crossings
- ✅ Verified that the layout adapts to different viewport sizes and workflow structures

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Centralized Layout Logic**: All layout-related code is now in one place, making it easier to maintain and update.
2. **Intelligent Layout Algorithm**: The DAG layout algorithm positions nodes based on their relationships, creating a more intuitive visualization.
3. **Adaptive Scaling**: The layout automatically scales to fit the available space, eliminating unnecessary scrolling.
4. **Configurable**: Layout parameters can be easily adjusted through the configuration system.
5. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: The new structure clearly separates different responsibilities, making the code more maintainable and extensible.
